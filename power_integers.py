#this program will create two separate text files after reading the source text file named integers.txt that contains 20 integers
#the first output file will be named double.txt containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt
#the second file will be named triple.txt containing the sube of all odd numbers found in the integers.txt

#import modules
import math

#list variables
even_list = []
square_list = []
odd_list = []
cube_list = []

#read the text file integers.txt


#read every line of the text file integers.txt and convert from string to integers


#determine if the numbers are even or odd


#get the square value of the even numbers from integers.txt


#get the cube value of the odd numbers from integers.txt


#create a new text file for square numbers


#create a new text file for cube numbers


#this is the end of the program
